<h1 align-center>NERDSWEB</h1>
<p>Welcome to the nerdsweb. We are so excited to have you. With your help, we can build out NERDSWEB to be more stable and better serve our community.</p>
<h2>What is Nerdsweb</h2>
<p>nerdsweb is a platform where software developers write articles, take part in discussions, and build their professional profiles. We value supportive and constructive dialogue in the pursuit of great code and career growth for all members. The ecosystem spans from beginner to advanced developers, and all are welcome to find their place within our community.</p>
<h3>Contributing</h3>
<p>We encourage you to contribute to nerdsweb! Please check out the Contributing to nerds guide for guidelines about how to proceed.

We expect contributors to abide by our underlying code of conduct. All conversations and discussions on GitHub (issues, pull requests) and across nerdsweb must be respectful and harassment-free.</p>

<h4>Where to contribute</h4>
<p>Building features is the area which will require the most communication and/or negotiation. Every feature is subjective and open for debate. If your feature involves user-facing design changes, please provide a mockup first so we can all get on the same page. As always, when in doubt, ask!</p>

<h5>How to contribute</h5>
<p>1. Fork the project & clone locally. Follow the initial setup here.</p>
<p>2. Create a branch, naming it either a feature or bug: git checkout -b feature/that-new-feature or bug/fixing-that-bug</p>
<p>3. Code and commit your changes. git commit -m 'Add some feature'</p>
<p>Push to the branch: git push origin feature/that-new-feature</p>

<h5>Contribution guideline</h5>
<h6>Create an issue<h6>
<p>Nobody's perfect. Something doesn't work? Or could be done better? Let us know by creating an issue.</p>
<p>PS: a clear and detailed issue gets lots of love, all you have to do is follow the issue template!</p>
<h5>Create a pull request</h5>
<li>Try to keep the pull requests small. A pull request should try its very best to address only a single concern.</li>
<li>Make sure all tests pass and add additional tests for the code you submit.</li>
<li>Document your reasoning behind the changes. Explain why you wrote the code in the way you did. The code should explain what it does.</li>
<li>If there's an existing issue related to the pull request, reference to it by adding something like References/Closes/Fixes/Resolves #305, where 305 is the issue number. </li>
<li>If you follow the pull request template, you can't go wrong.</li>
<i>Please note: all commits in a pull request will be squashed when merged, but when your PR is approved and passes our CI, it will be live on production!</i>


<p>Happy Coding ❤️</p>
